# CPP
CPP is a list of projects from [42 Network](https://www.42.us.org/). The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of C++ and Object Oriented Programming.

## How to use

- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/iLucasPires/cpp`
- Every project has a `Makefile` that will compile the code and generate an executable file
- Every executable file will be named `program` or as specified in the project (check the `Makefile`)

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (clang++ or g++)
- Make

## TODO

- [ ] add README.md to each project and a mini explanation
- [ ] add a full explanation for complex modules (ex: module 09)
